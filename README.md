### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently learning the following:
  - The inner workings of Garry's Mod.
  - Unity, and FiveM combined with Anti-Cheats for both.

  
I'm  working on currently:
  - Garry's Mod
    - A Prophunt Garry's Mod server
    - A Custom Roleplay server for Garry's Mod
    - If you wish to contact me about either of these please do so on Discord.
    - Garry's Mod Alt, and Cheat detection. (I will not respond to questions about this)
  - Decompiling and deobfuscating IL2CPP a few Unity games
  - and more I might list here later
Contact me via Discord, same name #4896
